# 🎵 PHONON: The Tidal + Glicol Hybrid
# =====================================
# This is a 4-on-the-floor house beat using:
# - Tidal/Strudel mini-notation (euclidean rhythms, rests, repetition)
# - Glicol-style DSL audio routing (filters, mixing)

# 🥁 KICK - Euclidean 4-on-the-floor
# Syntax: "1(4,16)" = 4 pulses evenly distributed in 16 steps
kick = sine(55) * "1(4,16)"

# 👏 CLAP/SNARE - On the 2 and 4
# Syntax: "~" = rest, explicit positions
clap = sine(150) * "~ 1 ~ 1"

# 🎩 HI-HATS - Fast 16th notes with accents
# Syntax: "[1 0.5]*8" = repeat pattern 8 times
hats = square(9000) * "[1 0.5]*8"

# 🎸 BASS - Melodic pattern with rests
# Syntax: "[110 110 ~ 165]*2" = frequencies with rest, repeated
bass = saw("[110 110 ~ 165]*2") # lpf(800, 1.5)

# 🎚️ MIX - Add all layers together
out kick * 0.3 + clap * 0.2 + hats * 0.05 + bass * 0.25
