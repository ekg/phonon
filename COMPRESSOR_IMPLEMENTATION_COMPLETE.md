## What Was Implemented

### Compressor Audio Effect âœ…

A complete dynamic range compression effect with:
- **Envelope follower** with separate attack/release timing
- **dB-based threshold** (-60dB to 0dB) for musical control
- **Compression ratio** (1:1 to 20:1)
- **Attack/release times** (0.001s to 3.0s) for response shaping
- **Makeup gain** (0dB to 30dB) to compensate for level reduction

### Implementation Details

**File**: `src/unified_graph.rs`

**Added Components**:
1. `CompressorState` struct (lines 761-777) - Tracks envelope follower state
2. `Compressor` variant to `SignalNode` enum (lines 610-619)
3. Compressor algorithm in `eval_node()` (lines 1392-1450)

**Algorithm**:
```rust
// Envelope follower with attack/release
let coeff = if input_level > envelope {
    (-(1.0 / (attack_time * sample_rate))).exp()  // Attack
} else {
    (-(1.0 / (release_time * sample_rate))).exp() // Release
};
envelope = coeff * envelope + (1.0 - coeff) * input_level;

// Gain reduction calculation
if envelope > threshold_lin {
    let envelope_db = 20.0 * envelope.log10();
    let over_db = envelope_db - threshold_db;
    let reduction_db = over_db * (1.0 - 1.0 / ratio);
    gain_reduction = 10.0_f32.powf(-reduction_db / 20.0);
}

// Apply compression + makeup gain
output = input * gain_reduction * makeup_gain_lin;
```

## Parameter Reference

threshold_db:     -60.0 to 0.0   # Level above which compression starts
ratio:            1.0 to 20.0    # Compression ratio (4.0 = 4:1)

## Technical Details

### Envelope Follower

The compressor uses an exponential envelope follower with separate attack and release times:

- **Attack**: Fast response when signal increases (typical: 1-10ms)
- **Release**: Slower response when signal decreases (typical: 50-300ms)

This creates natural-sounding compression that responds quickly to transients but releases smoothly.

### Gain Reduction Calculation

1. Convert threshold from dB to linear
2. Track input level with envelope follower
3. Calculate how far above threshold: `over_db = envelope_db - threshold_db`
4. Calculate gain reduction: `reduction_db = over_db * (1 - 1/ratio)`
5. Convert to linear gain reduction
6. Apply makeup gain

### Why This Matters

Compression is essential for:
- **Controlling dynamics** - Taming peaks in drum hits or vocals
- **Glue compression** - Making mix elements sit together
- **Sidechain effects** - Ducking bass under kick drums
- **Limiting** - Preventing clipping in loud sections
