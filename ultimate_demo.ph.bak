tempo 2.0

# === LFO for modulation ===
lfo = sine(0.5) * 0.5 + 0.6
lfo_fast = sine(4) * 0.5 + 0.5

# === Pattern-modulated oscillators ===
# Bass line with changing pitches (C2, G1, F1, C2)
bass = saw("55 41 44 55") # lpf(lfo * 3000 + 200, 3)

# === Filter with pattern modulation ===
# Cutoff sweeps through different values
lead = square(220) # lpf("200 500 1000 2000", "2 5 8 3")

# === Drums with patterns ===
# Noise through rhythmic filter
drums = noise # lpf("100 100 100 5000", 10)

# === Mix everything ===
out bass * 0.2 + lead * 0.1 + drums * 0.15

# === Try these modifications: ===
# 1. Change tempo to 1.0 or 4.0
# 2. Change bass pattern: saw("55 55 41 49")
# 3. Add more resonance: lpf(cutoff, 15)
# 4. Change waveforms: square -> tri, saw -> sine
# 5. Modify the LFO speed: sine(0.5) -> sine(2)
# 6. Add another layer: + sine(880) * 0.05
