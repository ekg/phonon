# Drum & Bass Demo
# Fast breakbeats and heavy bass

tempo 3.0  # 180 BPM (fast!)

# KICK PATTERN
# Complex kick pattern with sample selection and dynamics
~kick = s("bd:0*2 bd:1 ~ bd:0 ~ bd:1 ~", "1.0 0.8 0.9 0.0 0.85 0.0 0.75 0.0")

# SNARE PATTERN
# Snare on 2 and 4 with ghost notes
~snare = s("~ sn ~ sn", 1.0, 0.0, "1.0 1.1")
~snare_ghost = s("~ ~ sn:1 ~", 0.4) * 0.5

# HI-HATS
# Rapid hi-hats (32nd notes) with dynamics and stereo
~hats = s("hh*32", "0.5 0.3 0.6 0.3 0.5 0.3 0.7 0.4", "-1 1 -0.5 0.5")

# Open hi-hat accents
~open = s("~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ oh ~", 0.6)

# BREAKS
# Euclidean pattern for variation
~perc = s("cp(7,16)", 0.4, "-1 1 0")

# Combine drums
~drums = ~kick + ~snare + ~snare_ghost + ~hats + ~open + ~perc

# BASS (Reese bass style)
# Heavy detuned bass with movement
~bass = supersaw("55 55 55 82.5", 0.6, 12)

# Filter sweep for bass
~lfo = sine(0.5) * 0.5 + 0.5
~bass_filtered = ~bass # lpf(~lfo * 1500 + 400, 0.85)

# Distort the bass
~bass_dist = dist(~bass_filtered, 4.0, 0.7)

# SUB BASS
# Pure sine for sub frequencies
~sub = sine("55 55 55 82.5") * 0.4

# PAD (optional atmospheric layer)
~pad = superfm(220, 1.5, 0.8) * 0.08

# EFFECTS
~drums_verb = reverb(~drums, 0.3, 0.5, 0.15)
~pad_chorus = chorus(~pad, 0.6, 0.3, 0.5)

# FINAL MIX
out = (
    ~drums_verb +
    ~bass_dist * 0.3 +
    ~sub * 0.25 +
    ~pad_chorus * 0.15
) * 0.75

# D&B PRODUCTION TIPS:
# 1. Keep kick punchy (not too long sustain)
# 2. Layer snares with ghost notes for groove
# 3. Use 32nd note hi-hats for energy
# 4. Heavy bass with distortion and detuning
# 5. Sub bass provides low-end foundation
# 6. Tempo: 170-180 BPM (3.0 cps â‰ˆ 180 BPM)
#
# Try building it live:
# - Start with kick + snare
# - Add hats gradually
# - Bring in the bass
# - Layer the sub
# - Add atmospheric pad
