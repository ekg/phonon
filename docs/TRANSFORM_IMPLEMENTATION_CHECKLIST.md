# Pattern Transform Implementation & Testing Checklist

**Purpose**: Systematic verification and implementation of all Tidal Cycles transforms
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-28
**Current Status**: 4 verified, ~50 implemented but untested, ~15 missing

---

## Methodology

For each transform, we verify 4 stages:
1. **✅ Parsed** - DSL syntax works (`Transform::Name` exists in parser)
2. **✅ Compiled** - Compiler handles it (case in `compile_transform`)
3. **✅ Implemented** - Pattern method exists and works
4. **✅ Tested** - Has 3-level verification tests (pattern query, onset detection, audio)

**Testing Requirements**:
- Level 1: Pattern query verification (exact event counts over 4-8 cycles)
- Level 2: Onset detection (audio events match expectations)
- Level 3: Audio characteristics (RMS, peak, frequency analysis)

## Implementation Workflow (TDD)

For EACH transform:

### 1. Write Failing Tests (30-45 min)
```bash
tests/test_transform_NAME.rs
```

```rust
#[test]
fn test_NAME_level1_pattern_query() {
    // Test pattern events over 4-8 cycles
    let pattern = parse_mini_notation("bd sn").TRANSFORM();
    let events = count_events_over_cycles(pattern, 8);
    assert_eq!(events, EXPECTED);
}

#[test]
fn test_NAME_level2_onset_detection() {
    // Render audio and detect onsets
    let audio = render_dsl("s \"bd sn\" $ NAME", 8);
    let onsets = detect_audio_events(&audio);
    assert_eq!(onsets.len(), EXPECTED);
}

#[test]
fn test_NAME_level3_audio_quality() {
    // Check RMS, peak, DC offset
    let audio = render_dsl("s \"bd sn\" $ NAME", 8);
    let rms = calculate_rms(&audio);
    assert!(rms > 0.01);
}
```

### 2. Run Test - Confirm Failure (2 min)
```bash
cargo test test_NAME
# Should fail if not implemented, or pass if buggy
```

### 3. Implement/Fix (30-60 min)
- Check if pattern method exists in `src/pattern_ops.rs` or `src/pattern_ops_extended.rs`
- If missing, implement it
- If exists, verify correctness
- Ensure compiler case exists in `src/compositional_compiler.rs`

### 4. Run Test - Confirm Pass (2 min)
```bash
cargo test test_NAME
# All 3 levels should pass
```

### 5. Manual Test (10 min)
```bash
# Create example file
cat > /tmp/test_NAME.ph << 'EOF'
tempo: 0.5
~test: s "bd sn hh cp" $ NAME ARGS
out: ~test
EOF

cargo run --release --bin phonon -- render --cycles 4 /tmp/test_NAME.ph /tmp/test_NAME.wav
cargo run --release --bin wav_analyze -- /tmp/test_NAME.wav
```

### 6. Commit (2 min)
```bash
git add tests/test_transform_NAME.rs src/pattern_ops*.rs src/compositional_compiler.rs
git commit -m "Verify/implement TRANSFORM with 3-level tests

- Level 1: Pattern query verification
- Level 2: Onset detection
- Level 3: Audio characteristics
- Test case: DESCRIPTION
"
```

## Next Session Start Here

**Current Focus**: TIER 3 - Advanced Transforms (Power Users)

**TIER 1 & 2 COMPLETE! 🎉** All 30 core and enhanced transforms verified with 3-level tests.

**Next Transform**: `rotL` (rotate left)

**Command to run**:
```bash
# 1. Create test file for rotation & iteration transforms
touch tests/test_transform_rotation.rs

# 2. Follow TDD workflow above
# 3. Test rotL, rotR, iterBack together
# 4. Commit when done
# 5. Move to next category: meta-transforms
```

**Quick Status Check**:
```bash
# Count verified transforms
rg "✅ FULLY VERIFIED" docs/TRANSFORM_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md | wc -l

# Count implemented but untested
rg "🟨 IMPLEMENTED" docs/TRANSFORM_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md | wc -l

# Run all transform tests
cargo test transform
```
