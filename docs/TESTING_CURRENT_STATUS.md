# Current Testing Status - What We Actually Have

## Summary

**Good news:** We have excellent testing infrastructure!
**Reality check:** We're not using it consistently across all features.

## What We Have ✅

### 1. Robust Test Utilities

**`tests/audio_test_utils.rs`** - FFT-based signal analysis:
- ✅ `find_dominant_frequency()` - FFT peak detection
- ✅ `compute_spectral_centroid()` - Frequency "center of mass"
- ✅ `measure_frequency_spread()` - Bandwidth analysis
- ✅ `find_frequency_peaks()` - Multi-peak detection
- ✅ `calculate_rms()` - Amplitude analysis
- ✅ `find_peak()` - Peak amplitude

**`tests/pattern_verification_utils.rs`** - Pattern-audio correlation:
- ✅ `get_expected_events()` - Extract events from patterns
- ✅ `detect_audio_events()` - Onset detection in audio
- ✅ `compare_events()` - Match expected vs. actual events

### 2. Test Coverage by Category

| Category | Tests | Using Advanced Analysis | Only RMS |
|----------|-------|------------------------|----------|
| **Synthesis** | ~15 tests | 12 (80%) | 3 (20%) |
| **Filters** | ~8 tests | 6 (75%) | 2 (25%) |
| **Pattern Transforms** | ~45 tests | 8 (18%) ❌ | 37 (82%) |
| **Sample Playback** | ~12 tests | 2 (17%) ❌ | 10 (83%) |
| **Effects** | ~6 tests | 1 (17%) ❌ | 5 (83%) |
| **Multi-output** | ~4 tests | 0 (0%) ❌ | 4 (100%) |

**Total:** ~90 tests, 29 using advanced analysis (32%), 61 using only RMS (68%)

## What We're Testing Well ✅✅

### Synthesis (80% good coverage)
**Files:** `test_superdirt_synths_continuous.rs`, `test_synth_gating_analysis.rs`

**Example - Good test:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_supersaw_produces_expected_spectrum() {
    let input = r#"bpm 120; out: supersaw(110, 0.3, 5) * 0.5"#;
    let audio = compile_and_render(input);

    let freq = find_dominant_frequency(&audio, 44100.0);
    assert!((freq - 110.0).abs() < 5.0, "Fundamental should be 110 Hz");

    let spread = measure_frequency_spread(&audio, 44100.0);
    assert!(spread > 20.0, "Detune should spread frequencies");
}
```

**Why this is good:** Verifies actual frequency content, not just "makes sound".

### Filters (75% good coverage)
**Files:** `test_filter_modulation.rs`, `test_pattern_frequency_debug.rs`

**Example - Good test:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_lpf_removes_high_frequencies() {
    let input = r#"bpm 120; out: saw(110) >> lpf(500, 0.7)"#;
    let audio = compile_and_render(input);

    let centroid = compute_spectral_centroid(&audio, 44100.0);
    assert!(centroid < 1000.0, "Low-pass should reduce centroid");
}
```

**Why this is good:** Verifies filter actually affects frequency content.

## What We're NOT Testing Well ❌❌

### Pattern Transforms (only 18% good coverage)
**Problem:** Most tests only check `rms > 0.001` - they don't verify transforms actually work!

**Example - Weak test:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_fast_transform() {
    let input = r#"bpm 120; out: s("bd") $ fast 2"#;
    let audio = compile_and_render(input);

    let rms = calculate_rms(&audio);
    assert!(rms > 0.001);  // ❌ Only checks audio exists!
}
```

**What this test tells us:**
- ✅ Code compiles
- ✅ Something plays
- ❌ **Does NOT verify fast 2 actually doubles event rate**
- ❌ **Does NOT verify timing is correct**

**Example - Strong test (we have a few like this):**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_fast_actually_doubles_speed() {
    let normal = r#"bpm 120; out: s("bd")"#;
    let fast = r#"bpm 120; out: s("bd" $ fast 2)"#;

    let audio_normal = compile_and_render(normal);
    let audio_fast = compile_and_render(fast);

    let events_normal = detect_audio_events(&audio_normal, 44100.0, 0.01);
    let events_fast = detect_audio_events(&audio_fast, 44100.0, 0.01);

    // ✅ Verify fast 2 actually doubles event count
    assert_eq!(events_fast.len(), events_normal.len() * 2,
        "fast 2 should double events");

    // ✅ Verify timing is correct
    let interval_normal = events_normal[1].time - events_normal[0].time;
    let interval_fast = events_fast[1].time - events_fast[0].time;
    assert!((interval_fast - interval_normal / 2.0).abs() < 0.005,
        "fast 2 should halve intervals");
}
```

**What we need:** More tests like the strong example for all 18 transforms.

### Sample Playback (only 17% good coverage)
**Problem:** Most tests check audio is produced, but don't verify:
- ✅ Samples trigger at correct times
- ✅ Correct samples are triggered
- ✅ Pattern parameters (gain, pan, speed) are applied

**Example - Weak test:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_sample_pattern() {
    let input = r#"bpm 120; out: s("bd sn hh cp")"#;
    let audio = compile_and_render(input);
    assert!(calculate_rms(&audio) > 0.001);  // ❌ Weak!
}
```

**What we need:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_sample_pattern_timing() {
    let input = r#"bpm 120; out: s("bd sn hh cp")"#;  // 4 samples in 1 cycle
    let (_, statements) = parse_dsl(input).unwrap();

    // Get expected pattern events
    let pattern = parse_mini_notation("bd sn hh cp");
    let expected = get_expected_events(&pattern, 0.5, 2.0);  // 120 BPM = 2 CPS
    assert_eq!(expected.len(), 4, "Should have 4 events");

    // Render audio
    let compiler = DslCompiler::new(44100.0);
    let mut graph = compiler.compile(statements);
    let audio = graph.render(22050);  // 0.5 seconds = 1 cycle

    // Detect actual events
    let detected = detect_audio_events(&audio, 44100.0, 0.01);

    // Compare
    let comparison = compare_events(&expected, &detected, 0.005);  // 5ms tolerance
    assert!(comparison.match_rate > 0.9,
        "At least 90% of events should match, got {:.1}%",
        comparison.match_rate * 100.0);
}
```

### Effects (only 17% good coverage)
**Problem:** No tests verify effects actually process audio correctly.

**Example - Current test:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_reverb() {
    let input = r#"bpm 120; out: reverb(s("bd"), 0.8, 0.5, 0.5)"#;
    let audio = compile_and_render(input);
    assert!(calculate_rms(&audio) > 0.001);  // ❌ Just checks audio exists
}
```

**What we need:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_reverb_increases_duration() {
    let dry = r#"bpm 120; out: s("bd ~ ~ ~")"#;  // Single kick
    let wet = r#"bpm 120; out: reverb(s("bd ~ ~ ~"), 0.8, 0.5, 0.5)"#;

    let audio_dry = compile_and_render(dry);
    let audio_wet = compile_and_render(wet);

    // Measure decay time (time to drop below noise floor)
    fn measure_decay(audio: &[f32], threshold: f32) -> f32 {
        for (i, &sample) in audio.iter().enumerate().rev() {
            if sample.abs() > threshold {
                return i as f32 / 44100.0;
            }
        }
        0.0
    }

    let decay_dry = measure_decay(&audio_dry, 0.001);
    let decay_wet = measure_decay(&audio_wet, 0.001);

    // ✅ Verify reverb actually extends duration
    assert!(decay_wet > decay_dry * 1.5,
        "Reverb should increase decay time by at least 50%");
}
```

## Action Plan (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Gaps (1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Verify patterns actually control audio timing

1. **Add onset-based tests for ALL pattern transforms** (18 transforms × 2 tests = 36 tests)
   - For each transform, add a test that verifies it affects timing correctly
   - Example: `test_fast_2_doubles_event_rate()`, `test_rev_reverses_timing()`
   - **Impact:** Closes the biggest gap - verifies transforms actually work

2. **Add sample trigger verification tests** (12 tests)
   - Verify samples trigger at pattern-specified times
   - Verify correct samples are triggered
   - Verify pattern parameters (gain, pan, speed) are applied
   - **Impact:** Ensures sample playback actually follows patterns

### Phase 2: Effects Verification (1 week)
**Goal:** Verify effects process audio correctly

3. **Add effects characteristic tests** (6 tests)
   - Reverb: decay time increase
   - Delay: echo spacing verification
   - Chorus: frequency spreading
   - Filters: spectral modification
   - **Impact:** Ensures effects actually work, not just pass through

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (ongoing)
**Goal:** Systematic verification of all features

4. **Create test templates** for common test patterns:
   - Pattern timing verification template
   - Effect characteristic template
   - Transform verification template

5. **Add CI requirement:** All new features must include:
   - At least one timing/onset-based test
   - Cannot rely solely on RMS > threshold

## How to Use This Document

**For new features:**
1. Don't just check `rms > 0.001`
2. Use `detect_audio_events()` to verify timing
3. Use `find_dominant_frequency()` for frequency-based parameters
4. Use `compare_events()` to match pattern events with audio

**For existing features:**
1. Pick a category from "weaknesses" above
2. Add strong tests using the utilities
3. Verify the feature actually works as documented

## Bottom Line

**We have the tools - we just need to use them more consistently!**

The user is right: we can't rely on "makes sound" as verification. We need to systematically verify that:
1. Pattern events → audio transients at correct times ✅ (infrastructure exists)
2. Transforms → correct timing changes ⚠️ (partially done)
3. Effects → correct signal characteristics ❌ (needs work)
4. Samples → trigger at correct times ❌ (needs work)

**The good news:** We don't need new infrastructure. We just need to apply our existing utilities more broadly.
