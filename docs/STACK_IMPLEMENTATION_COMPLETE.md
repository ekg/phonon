# Stack Operation Implementation - Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Fully implemented, tested, and documented

## Summary

Implemented the `stack` operation - THE KEY feature for per-voice gain control in Phonon. This allows patterns to be combined with individual control over each voice, eliminating the need for awkward kwargs syntax.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Parser Support (compositional_parser.rs)

Added list literal syntax to the DSL:

```rust
// New Expr variant
Expr::List(Vec<Expr>)

// Parser function
fn parse_list_expr(input: &str) -> IResult<&str, Expr>
```

**Syntax**: `[expr1, expr2, ...]` - comma-separated expressions in square brackets

### 2. Compiler Support (compositional_compiler.rs)

```rust
fn compile_stack(ctx: &mut CompilerContext, args: Vec<Expr>) -> Result<NodeId, String>
```

**How it works**:
1. Extracts list of expressions from first argument
2. Compiles each expression to a NodeId
3. Chains Add nodes to mix all signals: `Add(Add(a, b), c)`

### 3. Usage Examples

#### Per-Voice Gain Control (The Key Use Case!)
```phonon
~kick: s "bd" * 0.8
~snare: s "~ sn" * 1.0
~hh: s "hh*4" * 0.4
~drums: stack [~kick, ~snare, ~hh]
out: ~drums
```

#### Stack Oscillators
```phonon
~low: sine 110 * 0.3
~mid: sine 220 * 0.5
~high: sine 440 * 0.2
~chord: stack [~low, ~mid, ~high]
out: ~chord
```

#### Stack with Transforms
```phonon
~normal: s "bd sn"
~fast: s "bd sn" $ fast 2
~reversed: s "~ sn" $ rev
~layered: stack [~normal, ~fast, ~reversed]
out: ~layered
```

## Test Coverage

### 7 Tests - All Passing ✅

#### Basic Tests (4)
1. ✅ `test_stack_basic_oscillators` - Stacks two sine waves
2. ✅ `test_stack_with_different_gains` - Per-voice gain control
3. ✅ `test_stack_samples` - Stack sample patterns
4. ✅ `test_stack_with_transforms` - Stack with pattern transforms

#### E2E Audio Analysis Tests (3)
5. ✅ `test_stack_per_voice_gain_e2e` - Render to WAV + verify audio
6. ✅ `test_stack_oscillator_frequency_blend` - Frequency analysis
7. ✅ `test_stack_three_way_mix` - Three-way mix verification

**Test File**: `tests/test_stack_operation.rs` (315 lines)

### Test Results
```
cargo test --test test_stack_operation --quiet
test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 1.02s
```

## Why This Matters

### Before Stack
- ❌ No way to control individual voice gains
- ❌ Would need kwargs syntax: `s("bd sn", gain="0.8 1.0")` (doesn't exist, brittle)
- ❌ Cannot apply per-voice transforms

### After Stack
- ✅ Full per-voice gain control
- ✅ Each voice is a first-class pattern
- ✅ Can apply transforms to individual voices
- ✅ Fully composable with rest of DSL
- ✅ Clean, elegant syntax

## Pattern Combinator Philosophy

Stack demonstrates Phonon's pattern combinator approach:
- **Patterns are first-class** - can be assigned to buses
- **Composable** - combine patterns with operators
- **Uniform syntax** - no special cases for different operations
- **Tidal-compatible** - uses same conceptual model as Tidal

## Files Changed

### Source Code
- `src/compositional_parser.rs` - Added `Expr::List` and `parse_list_expr()`
- `src/compositional_compiler.rs` - Added `compile_stack()`

### Tests
- `tests/test_stack_operation.rs` - 7 comprehensive tests

### Examples
- `examples/stack_demo.ph` - Demonstrates all stack use cases

### Documentation
- `docs/TIDAL_OPERATORS_AUDIT.md` - Marked stack as exposed to DSL
- `docs/STACK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - This document

## Related Operations (To Be Implemented)

From `Pattern::` in src/pattern.rs, also need to expose:
- `cat(patterns)` - Concatenate patterns in sequence (fastcat)
- `slowcat(patterns)` - Alternate between patterns each cycle

These already exist in Rust, just need DSL exposure (same process as stack).

## Performance Notes

Stack operation has O(n) compilation complexity where n = number of patterns.
Runtime mixing is efficient - just adds signals together.

## Commit
```
commit 0adf66b
Author: Erik Garrison
Date: 2025-10-20

Implement stack operation for per-voice gain control

This is THE KEY feature for controlling individual voices in Phonon!
```

## CI Status

✅ Pushed to main branch
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ 7 new stack tests added
⏳ Waiting for GitHub Actions CI (expected to pass)

## Next Steps

1. Expose `cat` and `slowcat` (same approach as stack)
2. Add pattern-based DSP parameters (`gain`, `pan`, `speed` patterns)
3. Implement sample bank selection (`:n` syntax)

## Conclusion

**Stack is now fully functional and ready for live coding!**

This completes the per-voice gain control feature request and provides a solid foundation for future pattern combinator operations.
