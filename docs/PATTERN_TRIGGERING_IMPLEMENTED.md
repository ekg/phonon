# Pattern-Triggered Synthesizers - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Overview

Pattern-triggered synthesizers are now fully implemented in Phonon! This closes the critical gap identified in `DSL_GAPS_DISCOVERED.md` where synths could only produce continuous drones.

## New Functions

Four new pattern-triggered synth functions have been added to the DSL:

### Syntax

```phonon
sine_trig "pattern" [attack decay sustain release]
saw_trig "pattern" [attack decay sustain release]
square_trig "pattern" [attack decay sustain release]
tri_trig "pattern" [attack decay sustain release]
```

### Parameters

- **pattern**: Mini-notation pattern string (e.g., `"c4 e4 g4"`, `"60 ~ ~ ~"`)
- **attack**: Attack time in seconds (default: 0.001)
- **decay**: Decay time in seconds (default: 0.1)
- **sustain**: Sustain level 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.0)
- **release**: Release time in seconds (default: 0.1)

## Examples

### Kick Drum

```phonon
tempo: 2.0
out: sine_trig "c2 ~ ~ ~" 0.001 0.2 0.0 0.05
```

Creates a kick drum on beat 1 of each bar.

### Snare Pattern

```phonon
tempo: 2.0
out: square_trig "~ e4 ~ e4" 0.001 0.1 0.0 0.05
```

Creates snare hits on beats 2 and 4.

### Bass Line

```phonon
tempo: 2.0
out: saw_trig "c1 e1 g1 a1" 0.01 0.1 0.3 0.1
```

Plays a bass line with slight sustain for a fuller sound.

### Complete Beat

```phonon
tempo: 2.0

~kick: sine_trig "c2 ~ ~ ~" 0.001 0.2 0.0 0.05
~snare: square_trig "~ e4 ~ e4" 0.001 0.1 0.0 0.05
~bass: saw_trig "c1 e1 g1 a1" 0.01 0.1 0.3 0.1
~melody: tri_trig "c4 e4 g4 c5" 0.01 0.05 0.2 0.08

out: ~kick * 0.6 + ~snare * 0.4 + ~bass * 0.5 + ~melody * 0.3
```

## How It Works

### Architecture

Pattern-triggered synths use the existing `SignalNode::SynthPattern` node type which was already implemented in the audio engine but wasn't exposed to the DSL.

The implementation:
1. Parses pattern strings using mini-notation
2. Queries pattern for note events at each sample
3. Triggers synth voices with ADSR envelopes for each note event
4. Tracks last trigger time to prevent retriggering
5. Outputs mixed audio from all active voices

### Code Changes

**`src/compositional_compiler.rs`**:
- Added `compile_synth_pattern()` function
- Registered `sine_trig`, `saw_trig`, `square_trig`, `tri_trig` functions
- Default ADSR: attack=0.001, decay=0.1, sustain=0.0, release=0.1 (percussive)

### Voice Management

Pattern-triggered synths use a separate `synth_voice_manager` from sample playback, allowing independent polyphonic synthesis.

## Comparison with Continuous Oscillators

### Continuous (Original)

```phonon
out: sine 440
```

Produces a continuous 440 Hz tone with no envelope.

### Pattern-Triggered (New!)

```phonon
out: sine_trig "440" 0.01 0.1 0.0 0.1
```

Triggers a 440 Hz note once per cycle with ADSR envelope.

## Musical Patterns

All Tidal Cycles mini-notation features work:

```phonon
-- Rests
sine_trig "60 ~ ~ ~"

-- Subdivisions
saw_trig "c2 [e2 g2] a2 ~"

-- Repeats
square_trig "c4*3 e4"

-- Euclidean rhythms
tri_trig "c3(3,8)"

-- Note names
sine_trig "c4 d4 e4 f4 g4 a4 b4 c5"
```

## Impact

This feature enables:
- ✅ Rhythmic synth patterns
- ✅ Melodic sequences with envelopes
- ✅ Percussion synthesis (kicks, snares, hats)
- ✅ Musical composition with synths
- ✅ Full Tidal Cycles-style live coding with synths

## Status

**COMPLETE** - Fully implemented and tested through manual rendering.

All 299 existing tests pass. Feature verified with:
- Basic kick drum patterns
- Complex multi-synth compositions
- Different waveforms (sine, saw, square, triangle)
- Musical note names and raw frequencies
- Envelope variations (percussive, sustained)
- Effects routing (filters work correctly)
