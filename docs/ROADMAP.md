# Phonon Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-11
**Current Status**: ~75% feature-complete for core vision

---

## ✅ What's Working NOW

### Just Completed (This Session)
1. ✅ **Multi-output system**: `out1`, `out2`, etc. work in render and live modes
2. ✅ **Hush/Panic commands**: Full integration for silencing outputs and killing voices
3. ✅ **Sample bank selection**: Inline form `s("bd:0 bd:1 bd:2")` works with transforms
4. ✅ **Test coverage**: 191 tests passing (4 new sample bank tests + 8 multi-output/live)

### Previously Completed
1. ✅ **Pattern transformations**: `|>`, `<|` operators with `fast`, `slow`, `rev`, `every`
2. ✅ **Bidirectional signal flow**: `>>` and `<<` for routing
3. ✅ **--cycles parameter**: Now correctly accounts for tempo
4. ✅ **Complex pattern rendering**: `"bd sn hh*4 cp"` triggers all events correctly

### Core Features Working
- ✅ Voice-based sample playback (64 voices, polyphonic)
- ✅ Sample routing through effects: `s("bd sn") >> lpf(2000, 0.8)`
- ✅ Pattern-controlled synthesis: `sine("110 220 440")`
- ✅ Pattern-controlled filters: `saw(55) >> lpf("500 2000", 0.8)`
- ✅ Live coding with auto-reload (`phonon live`)
- ✅ Mini-notation: Euclidean rhythms, alternation, subdivision, rests
- ✅ Signal buses: `~lfo = sine(0.5)`
- ✅ Signal math: `~a + ~b`, `~osc * 0.5`
- ✅ Multi-output: `out1 = sine(110)`, `out2 = sine(220)`
- ✅ Hush/Panic: Backend for silencing and voice killing
- ✅ 187 tests passing (5 new multi-output tests)

## ❌ What's MISSING for Full Vision

### HIGH PRIORITY (Core Functionality)

#### 1. Multi-output System ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Fully working in render and live modes
**Priority**: COMPLETE

**What's working**:
- ✅ `out1`, `out2`, etc. work in render mode
- ✅ `out1`, `out2`, etc. work in live mode
- ✅ UnifiedSignalGraph supports multiple outputs
- ✅ `hush_all()` and `hush_channel()` methods implemented
- ✅ `panic()` method implemented (kills voices + silences)
- ✅ `hush`, `hush N`, and `panic` command parsing in live mode
- ✅ 8 comprehensive tests passing (5 multi-output + 3 live commands)

**Completed**:
- ✅ Multi-output backend infrastructure
- ✅ Render mode parser integration
- ✅ Live mode parser integration with actual method calls
- ✅ All tests passing

---

#### 2. Sample Bank Selection ✅ INLINE FORM COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Inline form working, 2-arg form not yet implemented
**Priority**: HIGH - needed for expressive sample playback

**What's working**:
```phonon
s("bd:0 bd:1 bd:2")           # ✅ Inline sample numbers WORK
s("bd:0 bd:1") |> fast 2      # ✅ Works with transforms
```

**Still needed**:
```phonon
s("bd", "0 1 2 3")            # ❌ Pattern for sample number (2-arg form)
```

**Implementation completed**:
- ✅ Updated mini-notation parser to handle `:` in sample names (mini_notation_v3.rs:140)
- ✅ Parse `s("bd:0")` into sample name + number (sample_loader.rs already had this)
- ✅ SampleBank supports numbered sample lookup (existing functionality)
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests (tests/test_sample_bank_selection.rs)
- ✅ End-to-end audio rendering verification

**Tests passing**:
- ✅ Test `s("bd:0 bd:1 bd:2")` picks different samples
- ✅ Test mini-notation preserves colon syntax
- ✅ Test fallback behavior for out-of-range indices
- ✅ End-to-end audio rendering with sample selection

**Remaining work**:
- [ ] Implement 2-arg form: `s("name", "pattern")` (optional enhancement)

---

#### 3. Pattern DSP Parameters
**Status**: Not implemented
**Priority**: HIGH - needed for per-voice control

No per-voice/per-event control. Need:
```phonon
s("bd sn", gain="0.8 1.0", pan="0 1")
s("bd", speed="1 0.5 2", cut="1")
s("hh*16", gain="0.5", pan=sine(0.25))  # Continuous modulation
```

**Parameters needed**:
- `gain` - amplitude (0.0-1.0+)
- `pan` - stereo position (-1.0 = left, 1.0 = right)
- `speed` - playback rate (1.0 = normal, 0.5 = half speed, 2.0 = double)
- `cut` - cut group (samples with same cut group stop each other)
- `attack` - envelope attack time (seconds)
- `release` - envelope release time (seconds)

**Implementation tasks**:
- [ ] Add kwargs parsing to `s()` function
- [ ] Store per-voice parameters in VoiceManager
- [ ] Implement gain scaling per voice
- [ ] Implement pan (stereo positioning)
- [ ] Implement speed (sample rate adjustment)
- [ ] Implement cut groups (voice stealing)
- [ ] Implement envelope parameters
- [ ] Add tests for each parameter

**Test cases needed**:
- Test gain patterns affect amplitude
- Test pan patterns affect stereo position
- Test speed patterns affect playback rate
- Test cut groups stop previous voices
- Test envelope shapes

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 days

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced Functionality)

#### 4. More Effects
**Status**: Only lpf/hpf implemented
**Priority**: MEDIUM - nice to have, not blocking

Need:
```phonon
~drums >> reverb(0.5, 0.8)     # Reverb (size, mix)
~bass >> delay(0.25, 0.6)      # Delay (time, feedback)
~lead >> distort(0.7)          # Distortion (amount)
~mix >> compress(4.0, 0.7)     # Compressor (ratio, threshold)
~drums >> crush(8)             # Bitcrusher (bits)
```

**Implementation tasks**:
- [ ] Add reverb node (Freeverb or similar)
- [ ] Add delay node (circular buffer)
- [ ] Add distortion node (waveshaping)
- [ ] Add compressor node (dynamics)
- [ ] Add bitcrusher node (sample rate reduction)
- [ ] Add tests for each effect

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 days (1 day per 2 effects)

---

#### 5. MIDI Output
**Status**: Basic handler exists but not integrated
**Priority**: MEDIUM - useful for hardware integration

Need:
```phonon
midi("c4 e4 g4")               # Send pattern as MIDI notes
midi("c4 e4", velocity="64 127")
midi("c4 e4", channel=1)
```

**Implementation tasks**:
- [ ] Add `midi()` function to parser
- [ ] Wire to existing MidiOutputHandler
- [ ] Map pattern values to MIDI notes
- [ ] Support velocity patterns
- [ ] Support channel selection
- [ ] Add tests

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 days

---

#### 6. More Pattern Transformations
**Status**: Basic ones implemented (fast, slow, rev, every)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - nice to have

Need:
```phonon
"bd sn" |> jux(rev)            # Stereo manipulation
"bd sn" |> stut(3, 0.5, 0.125) # Delay/echo
"bd sn" |> chop(4)             # Sample slicing
"bd sn" |> degradeBy(0.3)      # Probabilistic removal
"bd sn" |> scramble            # Randomize order
```

**Implementation tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `jux` (apply transform to one channel)
- [ ] Implement `stut` (stuttering delay)
- [ ] Implement `chop` (slice samples)
- [ ] Implement `degradeBy` (random removal)
- [ ] Implement `scramble` (shuffle)
- [ ] Add tests for each

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 days

---

### LOWER PRIORITY (Nice-to-Have)

#### 7. Pattern Buses
**Status**: Broken for Sample patterns
**Priority**: LOW - workaround exists (use signal buses)

Currently broken:
```phonon
~a: s("bd sn")
~b: ~a |> rev
out ~a + ~b * 0.5  # Produces silence
```

**Issue**: Pattern buses don't work the same way as signal buses

**Possible solutions**:
1. Make pattern buses evaluate and cache at sample rate
2. Remove pattern buses entirely (use signal buses only)
3. Document limitation and provide workarounds

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 days (if we fix it) or 1 hour (if we document it)

---

#### 8. REPL Improvements
**Status**: Experimental, basic functionality only
**Priority**: LOW - file-based workflow works fine

Improvements needed:
- Better error messages
- Tab completion for functions/buses
- Pattern preview (show what pattern will play)
- History navigation
- Multi-line editing

**Estimated effort**: 3-5 days

---

#### 9. Documentation Updates
**Status**: Outdated and incomplete
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH - important for users

Tasks:
- [ ] Update PHONON_LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md to use `=` instead of `:`
- [ ] Remove `|>` references from old docs (now implemented)
- [ ] Add tutorial for beginners (QUICK_START.md)
- [ ] Add cookbook of common patterns
- [ ] Document what works vs. what's planned
- [ ] Add comparison to Tidal/Strudel (why Phonon is different)
- [ ] Update README with latest features

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 days

---

## 🎯 The Unique Vision

### What Makes Phonon Different

**Tidal/Strudel** (Event-based):
```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd sn"  # Triggers discrete events
```

**Phonon** (Signal-based):
```phonon
out = sine("110 220 440") * 0.2  # Pattern IS the control signal
```

### The Core Differentiator

In Phonon, **patterns evaluate at sample rate** (44.1kHz) and can modulate **any** synthesis parameter continuously. This is **impossible** in Tidal/Strudel where patterns only trigger discrete events.

### What You Can Do in Phonon (but not Tidal)

```phonon
tempo 1.0
~lfo = sine(0.25)                           # LFO pattern
~bass = saw("55 82.5 110")                  # Frequency pattern
out = ~bass >> lpf(~lfo * 2000 + 500, 0.8) # Pattern modulates filter!
```

In Tidal, you can't use patterns to modulate synthesis parameters in real-time. Patterns only control when events are triggered. In Phonon, patterns ARE the control signals.

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

For each feature:

1. **Write failing test** that demonstrates desired behavior
2. **Run test** to confirm it fails
3. **Implement minimal code** to make test pass
4. **Run test** to confirm it passes
5. **Refactor** if needed
6. **Document** the feature

Example workflow:
```bash
# 1. Write test
tests/test_multi_output.rs

# 2. Run test (should fail)
cargo test test_multi_output

# 3. Implement feature
src/main.rs
src/unified_graph.rs

# 4. Run test (should pass)
cargo test test_multi_output

# 5. Commit
git add tests/test_multi_output.rs src/main.rs src/unified_graph.rs
git commit -m "Implement multi-output system with tests"
```

## Questions to Answer

1. How many outputs do we need? (4? 8? 16?)
2. Should pattern buses be fixed or removed?
3. Do we need all Tidal effects, or just the essential ones?
4. Is MIDI output important for your workflow?
5. What should default sample bank selection behavior be?

## Notes

- Architecture is solid - no major refactoring needed
- Focus on filling in missing conveniences
- Maintain test coverage as we add features
- Document what makes Phonon unique vs Tidal/Strudel
- Keep TDD workflow: test first, implement second
