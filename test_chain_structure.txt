Looking at the code:

1. In compositional_parser.rs line 95:
   Chain(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),
   - This is defined as: a # b (pipe a into b)

2. In compositional_compiler.rs lines 629-632:
   Expr::Chain(left, right) => {
       compile_chain(ctx, *left, *right)
   }

3. In compositional_compiler.rs lines 6156-6207 (compile_chain function):
   - Left is compiled first
   - Left's result is passed as FIRST ARGUMENT to right
   - This is done via ChainInput marker

4. The actual implementation at line 6162-6164:
   let left_node = compile_expr(ctx, left)?;
   args.insert(0, Expr::ChainInput(left_node));
   compile_function_call(ctx, &name, args)

Key insight: The LEFT side determines the AUDIO that flows into the RIGHT side effect.
The RIGHT side is the EFFECT function.
