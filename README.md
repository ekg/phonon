# 🔊 Phonon

**Live coding synthesis + patterns in pure Rust**

Phonon is a live coding audio system where **patterns ARE signals**. Unlike Tidal/Strudel (event-based), Phonon uses a unified signal graph where patterns can modulate synthesis parameters in real-time.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Live coding (auto-reloads on file save)
./target/release/phonon live mytrack.ph

# Render to WAV
./target/release/phonon render input.ph output.wav --duration 10
```

**Create `mytrack.ph`:**
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Classic house beat (TidalCycles style!)
out: s "[bd*4, hh*8, ~ sn ~ sn]" * 0.8
```

Save it and hear it change instantly!

## What Makes Phonon Different?

### Patterns as Control Signals

**Tidal/Strudel** (event-based):
```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd sn"  # Triggers discrete events
```

**Phonon** (signal-based):
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
out: sine "110 220 440" * 0.2  # Pattern IS the control signal
```

In Phonon, patterns evaluate **at sample rate** (44.1kHz) and can modulate any synthesis parameter:

```phonon
tempo: 2.0
~lfo: sine 0.25
~bass: saw "55 82.5 110" # lpf (~lfo * 2000 + 500) 0.8
out: ~bass * 0.3
```

This is **not possible** in Tidal/Strudel - patterns trigger events, they don't continuously modulate synthesis.

## Features

✅ **Pattern System**:
- Mini-notation: `"bd sn cp hh"`
- Euclidean rhythms: `"bd(3,8)"`
- Alternation: `"bd <sn cp>"`
- Multiplication: `"bd*4"`
- Rests: `"bd . sn ."`
- Grouping: `"[bd sn] hh"`
- Transforms: `fast`, `slow`, `rev`, `every`, `degrade`, `stutter`, `palindrome`

✅ **Synthesis**:
- Oscillators: `sine`, `saw`, `square`, `noise`
- Filters: `lpf`, `hpf` with Q control
- Signal math: `~a + ~b`, `~osc * 0.5`
- Pattern modulation: `sine("110 220")`
- SuperDirt synths: `superkick`, `supersaw`, `superpwm`, etc.

✅ **Sample Playback**:
- Voice-based polyphonic engine (64 voices)
- Pattern DSP parameters: `gain`, `pan`, `speed`, `n`, `note`, `attack`, `release`, `cut_group`
- Samples through effects: `s("bd sn") # reverb(0.8, 0.5, 0.3)`
- Pattern-controlled parameters: `s "bd*4" # gain "1 0.8 0.6 0.4"`
- Sample library compatible with Tidal/Dirt-Samples (12,532 samples)

✅ **Audio Effects**:
- Reverb (Freeverb algorithm)
- Delay (feedback delay line)
- Distortion (soft clipping)
- Bitcrush (bit depth + sample rate reduction)
- Chorus (LFO modulation)
- All effects can be chained and pattern-controlled

✅ **Live Coding**:
- Auto-reload on file save
- Sub-millisecond latency
- Real-time audio output

## Examples

### Classic House Beat
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Four-on-the-floor with hi-hats and snare
out: s "[bd*4, hh*8, ~ sn ~ sn]" * 0.8
```

### Euclidean Rhythms
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Tresillo pattern (3-against-8) with layered hi-hats
out: s "[bd(3,8), hh(5,16)]" * 0.7
```

### Pattern DSP Parameters
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Each kick has different gain, pan, and speed
out: s "bd*4" # gain "1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4" # pan "-1 0 1 0" # speed "1.0 1.2 0.8 1.5"
```

### Sample Selection
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Cycle through different kick samples using 'n' parameter
out: s "bd bd bd bd" # n "0 1 2 3" * 0.8
```

### Pattern Transforms
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Apply transformations to patterns
~drums: s "bd sn" $ fast 2 $ every 4 rev
out: ~drums * 0.8
```

### Synthesis + Samples
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Combine oscillators with sample patterns
~kick: s "bd ~ bd ~"
~bass: saw "55 82.5 110" # lpf 500 0.8
~hats: s "hh*16" # gain "0.6 0.8 0.7 0.9"
out: (~kick + ~bass * 0.2 + ~hats * 0.3) * 0.7
```

### Effects Processing
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Drums through delay and reverb
~drums: s "[bd sn, hh*8]"
~wet: ~drums # delay 0.25 0.6 0.3 # reverb 0.7 0.5 0.4
out: ~wet * 0.8
```

### LFO Modulation
```phonon
tempo: 2.0
# Pattern-controlled filter cutoff
~lfo: sine 0.25
~bass: saw 55 # lpf (~lfo * 2000 + 500) 0.8
out: ~bass * 0.3
```

### Basic Syntax

```phonon
# Comment
tempo: 2.0              # Cycles per second

# Bus assignment
~name: expression

# Output (required)
out: expression
```

### Oscillators

saw freq
square freq
noise
```

### Filters
```phonon
lpf cutoff q           # Low-pass
hpf cutoff q           # High-pass
```

### Samples
```phonon
s "bd sn cp hh"        # Plays from samples/ directory
```

### Sample DSP Parameters
```phonon

s "bd" # release 0.5                 # Release envelope
s "hh*16" # cut_group 1              # Voice stealing
```

### Audio Effects
```phonon
s "bd sn" # reverb 0.8 0.5 0.3       # room_size, damping, mix
s "bd" # delay 0.25 0.6 0.5          # time, feedback, mix
s "bd" # distortion 10.0 0.5         # drive, mix

```

### Signal Flow
```phonon
source # filter # effect    # Chain operator
```

### Math
```phonon
~a + ~b                # Add
~a * 0.5               # Multiply
~osc * "0.5 1.0"       # Pattern modulation
```

## Samples

Put sample files in `samples/` directory:

```
samples/
  bd/BD0000.WAV
  sn/SD0000.WAV
  cp/CP.WAV
  hh/HH0000.WAV
```

Compatible with [Tidal Dirt-Samples](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples).

---

## Architecture

Phonon uses a **unified signal graph** where patterns, synthesis, and samples all evaluate at sample rate (44.1kHz):

```
Pattern Nodes → Oscillator Nodes → Filter Nodes → Output
     ↓               ↓                  ↓            ↓
Every sample    Every sample      Every sample  44.1kHz
```

This differs from Tidal/Strudel which use **event-based** architecture:

```
Pattern Engine → Events (per cycle) → SuperDirt/WebAudio (per event)
```

### Key Differences

| Feature | Tidal/Strudel | Phonon |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Pattern evaluation | Per-cycle events | Sample-rate signals |
| Synthesis modulation | Limited | Continuous (patterns can modulate any param) |
| Sample playback | Event-triggered | Event-triggered + signal-graph routing |
| Language | Haskell/JS | Rust |
| Audio engine | SuperCollider/WebAudio | Pure Rust (cpal) |
| Latency | 10-50ms | <1ms |

**Future Enhancements** (optional polish):

- ⏳ Additional SuperDirt synth variants

**Architectural Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Oscillators are continuous (not event-triggered like samples)
- ⚠️  No polyphonic synth voices (workaround: use multiple oscillators or samples)

## Roadmap

See **[docs/PHONON_CURRENT_STATE.md](docs/PHONON_CURRENT_STATE.md)** for detailed discussion of design direction.

Key decisions:
- Stick with signal-graph architecture (not event-based like Tidal)
- Add essential pattern transformations (not all of Tidal)
- Keep simple Rust-native syntax
- Focus on what makes Phonon unique: patterns as control signals
